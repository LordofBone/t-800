# This module is for inserting priority-based events into a queue that is called and can perform actions from these
# events; the HK project has been designed with threading in mind. Prior projects have been 1 action at a time,
# this project will be able to do multiple things at once, such as detect a face and perform actions as well as
# process movements - this is where the event queue comes in, instead of just doing direct calls to modules to
# perform actions anything that needs doing will be passed into this queue and processed one at a time (the highest
# priority first, lower the number the higher the priority). Multiple threaded modules running all at once will have
# access to this queue and so will be able to pass their results and requests into it
