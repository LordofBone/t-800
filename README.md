### Installation & Setup

Make sure to clone the code out with:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/LordofBone/t-800.git`

So all submodules are downloaded.

You can ensure the latest submodules are checked out with:

`git submodule update --remote --recursive`

This requires quite a bit of hardware and setup, that is covered at my Hackster & Electromaker pages:
